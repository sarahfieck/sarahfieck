- 👋 Hi, my name is Sarah.
- 🌱 I’m a student at Chapman University. I am currently learning data science and machine learning-related topics. 
- 🖥️ Last semester, I became familiarized with R and Pandas for Python. 
- 🧠 I'm also familiar with programming fundamentals, object oriented programing, data communications & networks, and data structures & algorithms.

- 💕 Most of my repos are private due to them being for classes. If you are interested in hearing about what I learned, I am more than happy to discuss.
- 📫 You can reach me through my LinkedIn - **https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahfieck/** Shoot me a message!
