- 👋 Hi, I’m @sarahfieck
- 🌱 I’m a student at Chapman University. I am currently learning data science and machine learning-related topics. 
- 🖥️ Last semester, I became familiarized with R and Pandas for Python.

- 🎵 I'm so grateful that data science has many applications. I'm personally interested in projects focusing on music and media. 
- ☮️ I also am interested in using data science for activism and humanitarian efforts. Data can be a great tool for social change.

- 💕 Most of my repos are private due to them being for classes. If you are interested in hearing about what I learned, I am more than happy to discuss.
- 📫 You can reach me through my LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahfieck/ Shoot me a message!
